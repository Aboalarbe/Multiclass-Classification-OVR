# Multiclass Classification
implement One-versus-Rest (OvR) strategy transforming multiclass classification
problems to multiple binary classification problems.

## Dataset
During this assignment, Seeds dataset is used. Training and test splits are provided in csv file format.
Seeds dataset has 7 attributes (features) and 3 classess (Kama, Rosa and Canadian) that are named as
numerical index 1,2 and 3, respectively. In order to visualize data and have better intuition, first and fifth
features, that are more meaningful, will be used.

## One-versus-Rest (OvR)
OvR strategy involve training a set of binary classclassifiers for each class. During testing process, each
classifier will predict the confidence of each class and the one with highest confidence will be selected.
